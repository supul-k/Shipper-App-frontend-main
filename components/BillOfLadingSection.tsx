              the Ocean Carrier plus one or more Inland Carriers. (D) "Port to Port Transportation" means carriage of the Goods under this Bill of
              Lading other than combined transport. (E) "Merchant" includes the shipper, consignor, consignee, owner, and receiver of the Goods and

              this Bill of Lading shall have effect subject to the provisions of the "Hague Rules", namely the International Conventions for the
              Unification of Certain Rules Relating to Bills of Lading, dated at Brussels, August 25, 1924, as amended (including, where enacted, the
              Protocol dated at Brussels, February 23, 1968, known as the Visby Rules), as enacted in the country of shipment. When no such enactment
              is in force in the country of shipment or is otherwise compulsorily applicable, the Hague Rules as enacted in the country of destination
              shall apply. When no such enactment is in force in the country of shipment or in the country of destination,
              <div className="html2pdf__page-break"></div> or is otherwise compulsorily applicable, the terms of the Hague Rules as enacted by the
              Convention shall apply. (B) If this Bill of Lading covers Goods moving to or from ports of the United States in foreign trade, then
              carriage of such goods shall be subject to the provisions of the United States Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1936, 46 U.S.C. P1300 the
              terms of which shall be incorporated herein. The provisions of U.S. COGSA shall (except as otherwise specifically provided in this Bill
              of Lading) govern throughout the time when the Goods are in the custody of the Ocean Carrier and any other water carrier and as
              otherwise provided in this Bill of Lading. 3. (Law and Jurisdiction) Whenever the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1936 (COGSA) of the
              United States of America applies, this contract is to be governed by United States Law. In all other cases actions against the Carrier
              may be instituted only in the country where the Carrier has its principal place of business and shall be decided according to the law of
              such country. 4. (Limitation of Liability Statutes) Nothing in this Bill of Lading shall operate to limit or deprive the Ocean Carrier
              of any statutory protection, exemption from, or limitation of liability authorized by the applicable laws, statutes, or regulations of
              any country. 5. (Sub Contracting: Exemptions and Immunities of Subcontractors) (A) The Ocean Carrier shall be entitled to subcontract on
              any terms the whole or part of the handling, storage, or carrier of the Goods and any and all duties whatsoever undertaken by the Ocean
              Carrier in relation to the Goods. (B) Merchant warrants that no claim shall be made against any Subcontractor (as defined in Article 1
              (J), or Subcontractor, of Ocean Carrier, except Inland Carriers where otherwise appropriate, that imposes or attempts to impose upon any
              of them or any vessel owned or operated by any of them any liability in connection with the Goods, and, if any such claims should
              nevertheless be made, to indemnify the Ocean Carrier against all consequences of such claims. (C) Without prejudice to the foregoing,
              every Subcontractor (and Subcontractor's Subcontractor) shall have the benefit of all provisions in this Bill of Lading for the benefit
              of the Ocean Carrier as if such provisions were expressly for the Subcontractor's benefit. In entering into this contract the Ocean
              Carrier, to the extent of those provisions, does so not only on its own behalf of such Subcontractors. 6. (Route to Transport) (A) The
              Goods may, at the Ocean Carriers absolute discretion, be carried as a single shipment or as several shipments by the Vessel and/or any
              other means of transport by land, water, or air and by any route whatsoever, whether or not such route is the direct, advertised, or
              customary route. (B) The Vessel shall have liberty to call and/or stay at any port or place in or out of the direct, advertised, or
              customary route, once or more often and in any order, and/or to omit calling at any port or place whether scheduled or not. (C) The
              Vessel shall have liberty , either with or without the Goods on board and either before or after proceeding toward the port of discharge
              to adjust to compasses and other navigational instruments, make trial trips or tests, dry dock, go to repair yards, shift berths, take
              on fuel or stores, embark or disembark any person, carry contraband, explosives, munitions, war like stores and hazardous cargo, sail
              with or without pilots, tow or be towed, and save or attempt to save life or property. (D) If the Goods in whole or in part are for any
              reason not carried on the Vessel named in this Bill of Lading, or if loading the Goods is delayed or is likely to detain the Vessel, the
              Vessel may proceed without carrying or loading the Goods in whole or in part, and notice to merchant of such sailing is hereby waived.
              Ocean Carrier may forward the Goods under the terms of this Bill of Lading on the next available ship or at option by any other means of
              transportation, whether by land, water or air. (E) At Ocean Carrier's option and without notice to Merchant, another ship or ships may
              be substituted for the Vessel named in this Bill of Lading, whether or not the substitute ship is owned or operated by Ocean Carrier or
              arrives or departs, or is scheduled to arrive or depart, before or after the Vessel named by this Bill of Lading. (F) Any action taken
              by the Ocean Carrier under this Article 6 shall be deemed to be included within the contractual carriage and such action, or delay
              resulting therefrom, shall not be considered a deviation. Should the Ocean Carrier be held liable in respect of such action, the Ocean
              Carrier shall be entitled to the full benefit of all privileges, rights, and immunities contained in this Bill of Lading. 7.
              (Responsibility) (A) Insofar as this Bill of Lading is used for Port to Port Transportation of the Goods, the Ocean Carrier shall not be
              responsible for loss of or damage to the Goods caused before loading or after discharge "Loading" shall be deemed to commence with the
              hooking on the vessel's tackle, or if not using the vessel's tackle, with the receipt of the Goods on deck or in the hold of (if the
              Goods are in bulk liquid) in the vessel's permanent pipe connections. "Discharge" shall be deemed to be completed when the Goods have
              been unhooked from the vessel's tackle o removed from the vessel's deck or passed beyond the vessel's permanent pipe connections. (B)
              Insofar as this Bill of Lading is used for combined transport of the Goods, the responsibility of the Ocean Carrier and each Inland
              Carrier with respect to the Goods shall be limited to the period when the carrier has custody of the Goods, and no carrier, either Ocean
              or Inland, shall be responsible for any loss or damage caused while the Goods are not in its custody. Any claim for loss of o or damage
              to the Goods, including loss or damages resulting from delay, should be made against the carrier having custody of the Goods when the
              loss or damage or delay was caused. (C) If it is established by the Merchant that the Ocean Carrier is responsible for loss of or damage
              to or in connection with the Goods, such responsibility, subject to the provisions of this Bill of Lading, shall be to the extent
              following but not further: (1) With respect to loss or damage caused during the period from the time when the Goods arrived at the sea
              terminal at the port of loading to the time when they left the sea terminal at the port of discharge, or caused during any previous or
              subsequent period of carriage by sea or waterways, to the extent prescribed by the applicable Hague Rules as provided in Article 2. (2)
              Save as indicated (C) (i) above, with respect to loss or damage caused during the handling, storage or carriage of the Goods by Ocean
              Carrier's Subcontractor, to the extent to which such Subcontractor would have been liable to the Merchant if he had made a direct and
              separate contract with the Merchant in respect of such handling, storage or carriage, provided, however, that if the Ocean Carrier is
              not authorized under any applicable laws, rules or regulations to undertake such handling, storage, or carriage under its own
              responsibility, the Ocean Carrier shall only be liable for procuring such handling, storage or carriage. If such handling, storage or
              carriage occurred in or between points in Europe, or where otherwise applicable, such responsibility shall be governed (a) if by road by
              the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road, dated 19 May, 1956 (CMR); (b) if by rail, by the
              International Convention Concerning the Carriage of Goods by Rail, dated 25 February, 1961 (CIM); (c) if by air, by the Convention for
              the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air, signed Warsaw 12 October, 1929, as amended by the Hague
              Protocol dated 28 September, 1955 (Warsaw Convention); (d) If it is established by the Merchant that an Inland Carrier is responsible
              for loss of or damage to or in connection with the Goods, such responsibility shall be to the extent, but not further, than the Inland
              Carrier would have been liable to the Merchant if he had made a direct and separate contract with the Merchant in respect of handling,
              storage or carriage of the Goods, as applicable. (e) Notwithstanding foregoing Article 7 (A) or 7 (B), the Ocean Carrier does not
              undertake that the Goods shall arrive at the port of discharge or place of delivery at any particular time or in time to meet any
              particular market o ruse, and the Ocean Carrier shall not be responsible for any direct or indirect loss or damage that is caused
              through delay. (f) If this Bill of Lading is used for Port to Port Transportation, the column indicating final destination on the face
              of this Bill of Lading is solely for the purpose of the Merchant's reference, and the Ocean Carrier's responsibility for the Goods shall
              in all cases cease at the time of discharge of the Goods at the port of discharge. 8. (Liberties) (A) In any situation whatsoever
              whether or not existing or anticipated before commencement of or during the transport, which in the judgement of the Ocean Carrier

              vehicle, any person, the Goods or any property, or has rendered or is likely to render it in any way unsafe, impracticable, unlawful, or
              against the interest of the Ocean Carrier or the Merchant to commence or continue the transport or to discharge the Goods at the port of
              discharge or to deliver the Goods at the place of delivery by the route and in the manner originally intended by the Ocean Carrier, the
              Ocean Carrier (1) at any time shall be entitled to unpack the container(s) or otherwise dispose of the Goods in such way as the Ocean
              Carrier may deem advisable at the risk and expense of the Merchant and/or (2) before the Goods are loaded on the Vessel, a vehicle, or
              other means of transport at the place of receipt or port of loading, shall be entitled to cancel the contract of carriage without
              compensation and to require the Merchant to take delivery of the Goods and, upon his failure to do so, to warehouse or place them at any
              place selected by the Ocean Carrier at the risk and expense of the Merchant and/or (3) if the Goods are at a place awaiting
              transshipment, shall be entitled to terminate the transport there and to store them at any place selected by the Ocean Carrier at the
              risk and expense of the Merchant, and/or (4) if the Goods are loaded on the Vessel, a vehicle, or other means of transport whether or
              not approaching, entering, or attempting to enter the port of discharge or to reach the place of delivery or attempting or commencing to
              discharge, shall be entitled to discharge the Goods or any part of them at any port or place selected by the Ocean Carrier or to carry
              them back to the port of loading or place of receipt and there discharge them . Any actions under (3) or (4) above shall constitute
              complete and final delivery and full performance of this contract, and the Ocean Carrier thereafter shall be free from any
              responsibility for carriage of the Goods. (B) If, after storage, discharge, or any actions according to subpart (A) above the Ocean
              Carrier makes arrangements to store and/or forward the Goods, it is agreed that he shall do so only as agent for and at the sole risk
              and expense of the Merchant without any liability whatsoever in respect of such agency. The Merchant shall reimburse the Ocean Carrier
              forthwith upon demand for all extra freight charges and expenses incurred for any actions taken according to subpart (A), including
              delay or expense to the Vessel, and the Ocean Carrier shall have a lien upon the Goods to that extent. (C) The situations referred to in
              subpart (A) above shall include, but shall not be limited to, those caused by the existence or apprehension of war declared or
              undeclared, hostilities, riots, civil commotions, or other disturbances closure of, obstacle in, or danger to any port or canal,

              authority, or by any committee or person having under the terms of any insurance on the Vessel, the right to give such order, direction,

              to be tendered to steamship lines. Shipper agrees that Carrier is entitled to rely on the accuracy of such weights and to counter-sign
              or endorse it as Carrier’s own certified weight to the steamship line carrying the cargo. The Merchant agrees that it shall indemnify
              and hold the Carrier harmless from any and all claims, losses, penalties or other costs resulting from any incorrect or questionable
              verification of the weight provided by Merchant or its agent or contractor on which the Carrier relies. 10. (Use of Container) When the
              Goods are not already packed into a container at the time of receipt by the Ocean Carrier, the Ocean Carrier shall be at liberty to pack

              Merchant (B) The Ocean Carrier shall in no event be liable for, and the Merchant shall indemnify and hold the Ocean Carrier harmless
              from, any death of or injuries to persons, or loss of or damage to property, caused by the Ocean Carrier's container or its contents

              Merchant. (A) this Bill of Lading is prima facie evidence of the receipt only of the number on the face of this Bill of Lading. The
              condition and particulars of the contents <div className="html2pdf__page-break"></div>

              warranties, the Merchant and not the Ocean Carrier shall be responsible for, and the Merchant shall indemnify and hold Ocean Carrier
              harmless from, any resulting loss or damage to persons or property (including the Goods) (C) The Merchant shall inspect the container
              when it is furnished by or on behalf of the Ocean Carrier, and the container shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Merchant as
              being in sound and suitable condition for the purpose of the transport contracted for in this Bill of Lading, unless the Merchant gives
              notice to the contrary, in writing, to the Ocean Carrier before the transport. (D) If the container is delivered after transport by the
              Ocean or Inland Carrier with seals intact, such delivery shall be deemed to be full and complete performance of the Ocean Carrier's
              obligation under this Bill of Lading, and the Ocean Carrier shall not be liable for any loss of or damage to the contents of the
              container. (E) The Ocean and Inland Carrier shall have the right to open the container and to inspect its contents without notice to the
              Merchant, at such time and place as the Ocean or Inland Carrier may deem necessary, and all expenses incurred therefrom shall be borne
              by the Merchant. (F) If any seal of the container is broken by customs or other authorities for inspection of its contents, the Ocean

              any special container packed by or on behalf of the Merchant, but the Ocean Carrier will treat such Goods or container only as ordinary
              goods or dry container, respectively, unless: (1) special arrangements for the carriage of such Goods or container have been agreed to

              or container arising from latent defects, breakdown, or stoppage of the refrigeration or heating machinery, insulation, ship's plant, or
              other such apparatus of the Vessel or container, provided that the Ocean Carrier shall before or at the beginning of the transport
              exercise due diligence to maintain the special hold or container in an efficient state. (c) If the Goods have been packed into a
              refrigerated container by the Ocean or Inland Carrier, and the particular temperature range requested by the Merchants is inserted in
              this Bill of Lading, the Ocean Carrier will set the thermostatic controls within the requested temperature range but does not guarantee
              the maintenance of such temperature inside the container. (D) If the cargo received by the Ocean or Inland Carrier is in a refrigerated
              container packed by or on behalf of the Merchant, it is the obligation of the Merchant to stow the contents properly and set the

              the container. 14. (Dangerous Goods, Contraband) (A) The Ocean Carrier undertakes to carry Goods of an explosive, inflammable,
              radioactive, corrosive, damaging, poisonous, or dangerous nature only upon the Ocean Carrier's approval of a written application by the

              and the consignee. (B) The Merchant shall undertake that the nature and danger of such Goods is distinctly hand permanently marked on
              the outside of the package or container containing the Goods. (C) Merchant shall submit all documents or certificates required in
              connection with such Goods by any applicable statue or regulation or by the Ocean Carrier (D) Whenever the Goods are discovered to have

              contraband or prohibited by any law or regulation of any place during the transport, the Ocean Carrier shall be entitled to have such
              Goods rendered innocuous, thrown overboard, discharged, or otherwise disposed of at the Ocean Carrier's discretion without compensation,

              negotiable instruments, securities, writings, documents, works of art, curios, heirlooms, or any other valuable goods, including goods
              having particular value only for the Merchant, unless the true nature and value of the Goods have been declared in writing by the

              designated by the Ocean Carrier. Delivery of the Goods to the custody of customs or any other public authority shall constitute final
              discharge of the Ocean Carrier's responsibility. (C) In case the cargo received by the Ocean Carrier is containers packed by or on
              behalf of the Merchant (1) The Ocean Carrier shall only be responsible for delivery of the total number of containers received (2) The

            <span>
              Ocean Carrier shall not be responsible for any loss or damage to the contents of the container. (E) Optional delivery shall be granted
              only when arranged prior to the time of receipt of the Goods by Ocean Carrier and if expressly stated on the face of this Bill of
              Lading. The Merchant desiring to avail himself of the option so expressed must give notice in writing to the Ocean Carrier at the first
              port of call named in the option at least 48 hours prior to the Vessel's arrival there, otherwise the Goods shall be landed at any of
              the optional ports at Ocean Carrier's option, and the Ocean Carrier's responsibility shall then cease. (F) Ocean Carrier is not
              responsible to give notification, in writing or otherwise, either to Merchant or others, of the arrival, discharge, or disposition of
              Goods, any custom or agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, and notwithstanding any notation on the face of this Bill of Lading,
              concerning notification or a notify party. 21. (On-Carriage and Forwarding) (A) Whether arranged beforehand or not, the Ocean Carrier
              shall be at liberty without notice to carry the Goods wholly or partly by the named or any other Vessel, craft barge, or other means of
              transport by water, land or air, whether or not owned or operated by the Ocean Carrier. (B) The Ocean Carrier may under any
              circumstances whatsoever discharge the Goods or any part of them at any port or place for transshipment and store them afloat or ashore
              and then forward them by any means of transport. (C) If the Goods cannot be found at the port of discharge or place of delivery, or if
              they be miscarried, they, when found, may be forwarded to their intended port of discharge or place of delivery at the Ocean Carrier's
              expense, but the Ocean Carrier shall not be liable for any loss, damage, delay, or depreciation arising from such forwarding. (D) In
              case of Port to Port Transportation, transshipment of cargo, or receipt of cargo from ports or inland points not including within the
              ship's itinerary or the Ocean Carrier's service, is to be at the sole risk and expense of the Merchant, and neither the Ocean Carrier
              not its Vessel shall be deemed to be the agent or principal of a prior or subsequent carrier notwithstanding the issuance by the Ocean
              Carrier of a bill of lading, receipt, or other shipping document at a time or place prior to that at which the Goods are received by the
              Ocean Carrier 22. (Fire) The Ocean Carrier shall not be responsible for any loss of or damage to the Goods arising from fire occurring
              at any time, even though before loading on or after discharge from the Vessel, unless caused by the actual fault or privity of the Ocean
              Carrier. 23. (Lien) Carrier shall have a lien on any and all property (and documents relating thereto) of Merchant in its actual or
              constructive possession, custody or control or en route, for all claims for charges, expenses or advances incurred by Carrier in
              connection with this shipment, or any previous shipment, of Merchant, or both, which lien shall survive delivery, and if such
              <div className="html2pdf__page-break"></div>
              claim remains unsatisfied for 30 days after demand for its payment is made, Carrier may sell at public auction or private sale, upon 10
              days written notice, registered mail to Merchant, the goods, wares and/or merchandise or so much as may be necessary to satisfy such
              lien and the costs of recovery, and apply the net proceeds of such sale to the payment of the amount due Carrier. Any surplus from such
              sale shall be transmitted to Merchant, and Merchant shall be liable for any deficiency in the sale. 24. (Freight and Charges) (A)
              Freight may be calculated on the basis of the particulars of the Goods furnished by the Merchant, who shall be deemed to have guaranteed
              to the Ocean Carrier the accuracy of the contents, weight, measure, or value as furnished by him at the time of receipt of the Goods by
              the Ocean or Inland Carrier, but the Ocean Carrier for the purpose of ascertaining the actual particulars may at any time and at the
              risk and expense of the Merchant open the container or package and examine contents, weight, measure, and value of the Goods. In case of
              incorrect declaration of the contents, weight, measure and or value of the Goods, the Merchant shall be liable for and bound to pay to
              the Ocean Carrier: (1) the balance of freight between the freight charged and that which would have been due had the correct details
              been given, plus (2) expenses incurred in determining the correct details, plus (3) as liquidated and ascertained damages, an additional
              sum equal to the correct freight. (B) Full freight to the port of discharge or place of delivery shall be considered as completely
              earned on receipt of the Goods by the Ocean Carrier, whether the freight be stated or intended to be prepaid or to be collected at
              destination. The Ocean Carrier shall be entitled to all freight and other charges due hereunder, whether actually paid or not and to
              receive and retain such freight and charges under any circumstances, whether the Vessel and/or the Goods be lost or not, or the voyage
              be broken up, frustrated, or abandoned at any stage of the entire transit. Full freight shall be paid on damaged or unsound Goods. (C)
              The Payment of freight and/or charges shall be made in full and in cash without any offset, counter claim, or deduction. Where freight
              is payable at the port of discharge or place of delivery, such freight and all other charges shall be paid in the currency named in this
              Bill of Lading, or, at Ocean Carrier's option, in other currency subject to the regulators of the freight conference concerned, if any,
              or custom at the place of payment. (D) Goods once received by the Ocean Carrier cannot be taken away or disposed of by the Merchant
              except upon the Ocean Carrier's consent and after payment of full freight and compensation for any loss sustained by the Ocean Carrier
              through such taking away or disposal. (E) If the Goods are not available when the Vessel is ready to load: (1) The Ocean Carrier is
              relieved of any obligation to load such Goods and the Vessel may leave the port without further notice. (2) Unless the unavailability
              arises in the course of combined transport and is caused by the failure of an Inland Carrier to perform its obligations under this Bill
              of Lading, dead freight shall be paid by the Merchant. (F) The Merchant shall be liable for and shall indemnify the Ocean Carrier
              against: (1) all dues, duties, taxes, consular fees, and other charges levied on the Goods, and (2) all fines, damages and losses
              sustained by the Ocean Carrier in connection with Goods, howsoever caused, including the Merchant's failure to comply with laws and
              regulations of any public authority in connection with the Goods, or failure to procure consular, Board of Health, or other certificates
              to accompany the Goods. The Merchant shall be liable for return freight and changes on any Goods refused exportation or importation by
              any public authority. (G) If the Ocean Carrier is of the opinion that the Goods are in need of sorting, inspecting, mending, repairing,
              or reconditioning, or otherwise require protecting or caring for, the Ocean Carrier at its discretion may, by itself or through
              Subcontractors, and as agent for the Merchant, carry out such work at the risk and expense of the Merchant. (H) The shipper, consignor,
              consignee, owner of the Goods and holder of this Bill of Lading shall be jointly and severally liable to the Ocean Carrier for the
              payment of all freight and charges and for the performance of the obligations of any of them under this Bill of Lading 25. (Notice of
              Claim and Time for Suit against Ocean Carrier) (A) Unless notice of loss or damage and the general nature of such loss or damage be
              given in writing to the Ocean Carrier at the port of discharge or place of delivery before or at the time of delivery of the Goods or,
              if the loss or damage is not apparent, within 3 days after delivery, the Goods shall be deemed to have been delivered as described in
              this Bill of Lading. (B) The Ocean Carrier shall be discharged from all liability in respect of the Goods, including without limitation
              nondelivery, misdelivery, delay, loss, or damage, unless suit has been brought within one year after delivery of the Goods or the date
              when the Goods should have been delivered. Suit shall not be considered to have been "brought" within the time specified unless process
              shall have been served and jurisdiction obtained over the Ocean Carrier within such time. 26. (Limitation of Liability) (A) Subject to
              subpart (B) below for the purpose of determining the extent of the Ocean Carrier's liability for loss of or damage to the Goods, the
              Merchant agrees that the value of the Goods is the Merchant's net invoice cost, plus freight and insurance premium, if paid. The Ocean
              Carrier shall not be liable for any loss of profit or any consequential loss. (B) Insofar as the loss of or damage to or in connection
              with the Goods was caused during the part of the custody or carriage to which the applicable version of the Hague Rules applies: (1) The
              Ocean Carrier shall not be liable for loss or damage in an amount exceeding the minimum allowable per package or unit in the applicable
              version of the Hague Rules, which when U.S. COGSA is applicable is an amount not exceeding U.S. $500 per package or customary freight
              unit, unless the value (and nature) of Goods higher than this amount has been declared in writing by the Merchant before receipt of the
              Goods by the Ocean Carrier and inserted on the face of this Bill of Lading and extra freight has been paid as required. If the actual
              value of the Goods per package or unit exceeds such declared value, the value shall nevertheless be deemed to be the declared value, and
              the Ocean Carrier's liability, if any, shall not exceed the declared value. Any partial loss or damage shall be adjusted pro rata on the
              basis of such declared value. If the declared value has been willfully misstated or is markedly higher than the actual value, the Ocean
              Carrier shall not be liable to pay any compensation. (2) Where the cargo has been packed into a container or unitized into a similar
              article of transport by or on behalf of the Merchant, it is expressly agreed that the number of such containers or similar articles of
              transport shown on the face of this Bill of Lading shall be considered as the number of the packages or units for the purpose of the
              application of the limitation of liability provided for in this Article. 27. (General Average: New Jason Clause) (A) General average
              shall be adjusted, stated and settled at any port or place as the Ocean Carrier's option and according to the York Antwerp Rules, 1974
              and as to matters not provided for by these Rules, according to the laws and usages of the port or place of adjustment and in the
              currency selected by the Ocean Carrier. The general average statement shall be prepared by the adjusters appointed by the Ocean Carrier.
              Average agreement or bond and such cash deposit as the Ocean Carrier may deem sufficient to cover the estimated contribution of the
              Goods and any salvage and special charges thereon and any other additional securities as the Ocean Carrier may require shall be
              furnished by the Merchant to the Ocean Carrier before delivery of the Goods. (B) In the event of accident, danger, damage, or disaster
              before or after commencement of the voyage, resulting from any cause whatsoever, whether due to negligence or not for which or for the
              consequence of which the Ocean Carrier isn't responsible by statue, contract, or otherwise, the Goods and the Merchant shall jointly and
              severally contribute with the Ocean Carrier in general average to the payment of any sacrifices, loss, or expenses of a general average
              nature that may be made or incurred, and shall pay salvage and special charges incurred in respect of the Goods. If a salvage ship is
              owned or operated by the Ocean Carrier, salvage shall be paid for as fully and in the same manner as if such salvaging ship belonged to
              strangers. 28. (Both to Blame Collision) If the Vessel comes into collision with another ship as a result of the negligence of the other
              ship and any act, neglect, or default of the Master, mariner, pilot, or servants of the owner of the Vessel in the navigation or in the
              management of the Vessel, the Merchant shall indemnify the Ocean Carrier against all loss or liability which might be incurred directly
              or indirectly to the other or non carrying ship or her owners insofar as such loss or liability represents loss of or damage to his
              Goods or any claim whatsoever of the Merchant paid or payable by the other or non carrying ship or her owners to the Merchant and set
              off, recouped, or recovered by the other or non carrying ship or her owners as part of their claim against the carrying Vessel or its
              owner. The foregoing provisions shall also apply where the owners, operators, or those in charge of any ship or ships or objects other
              than, or in addition to the colliding ships or objects are at fault in respect of a collision contact stranding or other accident. 29.
              (Carriage of Metal Products, Lumber, Cotton) (A) The term "apparent good order and condition" when used in this Bill of Lading does not
              mean: (1) with reference to iron, steel, or metal products, that the Goods when received were free from visible rust or moisture. (2)
              with reference to lumber, timber, plywood, or other wood products, that the Goods when received were free from visible stains,
              discoloration, moisture, shakes, holes, chaffed, breakage or splitting. If the Merchant so requests a substitute bill of lading will be
              issued setting forth any notations as to the foregoing that may appear on the mate's or tally clerk's receipts or similar document. (B)
              Description of the condition of cotton cargo does not relate to the sufficiency or not or condition of the covering nor to any damage,
              resulting therefrom. Ocean Carrier shall not be responsible for any such damage. 30. (Grain) Discharge of grain received by the Ocean
              Carrier in bulk may be in port, on barges, and or lighters, or elsewhere, using or not using elevators, and such discharge shall
              constitute a sufficient delivery by the Carrier. Thereafter said grain shall be at the risk and expense of the Merchant. 31. (Intermodal
              Transportation) (A) This Bill of Lading may be issued for Intermodal Transportation in any country. When so issued as between the
              Merchant and an Inland Carrier custody and carriage of the Goods by the Inland Carrier are subject to the relevant laws, regulations,
              tariffs and bill of lading are available from the Ocean or Inland Carrier upon request. (B) Claims by the Merchant against an Inland
              Carrier for loss or damage shall be given and suit commenced as provided in the Inland Carrier's applicable bill of lading 32. (Ocean
              Carrier's Tariff) This Bill of Lading is subject to the Ocean Carrier's application tariff. Copies of the applicable tariff are
              obtainable from the Ocean Carrier upon request. 33. (Severability of Terms) The terms of this Bill of Lading are severable and if any
              part or term is declared invalid or unenforceable, the validity or enforceability, of any other part or term shall not be affected. 34.
              (Himalaya Clause) All exceptions, exemptions defenses immunities, limitations on liability, privileges and conditions granted or
              provided by this Bill of Lading or by applicable tariff or by statue or for the benefit of the Carrier shall also apply to and for the
              benefit of the officers and employees of the Carrier and the agents, officers and crew of the Vessel and to and for the benefit of all
              parties performing services in connection with the Goods as agents or contractors of the Carrier (including, without limitation,
              stevedores, terminal operators and agents) and the employees of each them.
